## Additional Notes:

The website will have a user-friendly and responsive design to ensure it is accessible on various devices. It will include error handling and validation to provide a smooth user experience. Security measures, such as hashing user passwords and preventing SQL injection, should be implemented to protect user data.

This project will serve as a comprehensive solution for the coffee shop to manage its product catalog, process orders, and interact with clients. It can also be expanded in the future to include additional features, such as online payments or loyalty programs.
